Experiment with skipping traditional bundlers

I need bundle reload without hard reload, calling it HBR- HOT BUNDLE RELOAD :-)

first experiment is with custom nodejs server (2 bundles)
next will be electron with main backend, browser + preload, and one seperate preload for background work (4 bundles)
